## Skills Demonstrated
- **Web Scraping**: Uses Selenium for automated extraction of job listing data.
- **Cloud Automation**: Implements Cloud Run and Cloud Scheduler for deploying and scheduling the scraper.
- **Data Management**: Utilizes BigQuery for efficient data storage and management.
- **Data Visualization**: Employs Looker Studio for creating insightful visual dashboards.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Selenium
- Google Cloud Platform: Cloud Run, Cloud Scheduler, BigQuery, Looker Studio

## Project Files
- `main.py`: Main script for scraping job listings.
- `app.py`: Flask application for deploying the scraper as a web service.
- `settings.py`: Configuration settings for API keys and database connections.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.
- `Dockerfile`: Docker configuration for building the application.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
- A Google Cloud Platform account. [Start your free trial here](https://cloud.google.com/free).
- Basic knowledge of Python and Selenium for web scraping.

### Configuration and Deployment
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-job-scraper.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Test the main.py locally to ensure the scraper functions correctly.**
   -  Run app.py using Flask locally to validate the web service.
   -  Deploy on Google Cloud Run

4. **Deploy on Google Cloud.**
   - Deploy the containerized Flask application on Cloud Run.
   - Set up Cloud Scheduler to automate the scraping process.

### Running the Project
   - Ensure all settings in settings.py are correctly configured, deploy the scraper to Google Cloud Run, and manage the scraping schedule with Cloud Scheduler.
